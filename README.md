# tasker
Test task for a company

Implemented:
Register user
login / logout

Add Task with next field:
* subject;
* status;
* author;
* assigned_to;
* time_estimate;
* time_spent;
* created_at;
* updated_at;

Update and Delete a task;

Logging changed with next field:
* action;
* task;
* data;
* user;

would like to do:
* fix time_spent - it's fast;
* popup from ajax - it's interesting;
* add pagination - it's fast;
* add django-messages - it's fast;

Thanks.
